## Flick Game

Just a simple game where you can challenge someone and see who can hit the targets first.

### ToDo
 - Routing to room
 - Actual game (lol)
 
### Techs
 - Express (backend)
 - Socket.IO
 - React
 - Canvas API (yet to be used)
 
### How to Run

Clone this repo and `flick-game-backend`. Run the backend then run the frontend. If you can clone a repository you can probably use a package manager / run scripts ðŸ˜›
